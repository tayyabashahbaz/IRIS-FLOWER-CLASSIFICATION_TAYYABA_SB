IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION-SUPERVISED ML PROJECT
This machine learning project classifies iris flowers into setosa,versicolor,or virginica based on their petal and sepal measurements using supervised ML model.
PROJECT TYPE: SUPERVISED ML
ALGORITHM:Decision Tree Cassifier
DATASET SOURCE:Built in iris dataset from 'sklearn.datasets'
FEATUER USED:petal length,petal width,sepal length,sepal width.
ACCURACY ACHIEVED:100% ON test dataset
load the iris dataset using'load_iris"from scikit-learn
split data into training and testing sets 
Train the Decision Tree Accuracy
Evaluate model accuracy
predict the species of new flower data
